        <h2>Core Features</h2>
        
        <h3>CPU-Friendly Mining Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Dogetoreum employs a mining algorithm designed to favor CPU mining, ensuring a lower barrier to entry for participants. This approach democratizes the mining process, discourages hardware centralization, and fosters a more decentralized network.</p>
        
        <h3>Smartnodes</h3>
        <p>Smartnodes are incentivized nodes that contribute to the networkâ€™s security, stability, and additional functionality. Operators of Smartnodes are required to stake a minimum amount of Dogetoreum, creating a robust and self-sustaining ecosystem.</p>
        
        <h3>On-Chain Assets</h3>
        <p>Dogetoreum enables users to create and manage assets directly on the blockchain. This feature supports tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized media capabilities, paving the way for diverse use cases.</p>
        
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>With its innovative consensus mechanism and optimized block structure, Dogetoreum ensures high transaction throughput without compromising decentralization or security.</p>
