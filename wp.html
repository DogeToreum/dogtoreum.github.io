  <h1>Dogetoreum Whitepaper</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum is a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain designed to empower a decentralized, efficient, and scalable financial ecosystem. Combining a CPU-friendly mining algorithm, Smartnodes, and support for on-chain assets, Dogetoreum introduces a secure and accessible platform for users and developers alike. With a total supply of 250,000,000,000 tokens, Dogetoreum aims to foster inclusivity and innovation in the cryptocurrency landscape.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The cryptocurrency space has witnessed significant growth, but challenges like centralization, scalability, and high entry barriers remain. Dogetoreum is built to address these issues by offering a fair, decentralized, and versatile blockchain. Inspired by the community-driven ethos of Dogecoin and the technological advancements of modern blockchains, Dogetoreum aims to be a bridge between simplicity and innovation.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Features</h2>
  <h3>CPU-Friendly Mining Algorithm</h3>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum employs a mining algorithm designed to favor CPU mining, ensuring a lower barrier to entry for participants. This approach democratizes the mining process, discourages hardware centralization, and fosters a more decentralized network.
  </p>

  <h3>Smartnodes</h3>
  <p>
    Smartnodes are incentivized nodes that contribute to the networkâ€™s security, stability, and additional functionality. Operators of Smartnodes are required to stake a minimum amount of Dogetoreum, creating a robust and self-sustaining ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h3>On-Chain Assets</h3>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum enables users to create and manage assets directly on the blockchain. This feature supports tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized media capabilities, paving the way for diverse use cases.
  </p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p>
    With its innovative consensus mechanism and optimized block structure, Dogetoreum ensures high transaction throughput without compromising decentralization or security.
  </p>

  <h3>Coin Emission Schedule</h3>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum features a predictable emission schedule designed to ensure network sustainability and incentivize participation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mining Rewards: 50%</li>
    <li>Smartnode Rewards: 50%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Block rewards are structured to encourage long-term network security and incentivize both miners and Smartnode operators.
  </p>

  <h3>Consensus Mechanism</h3>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to balance decentralization and efficiency. CPU miners verify transactions and produce blocks, while Smartnodes ensure additional layers of security and governance.
  </p>

  <h2>Use Cases</h2>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum's infrastructure supports a variety of use cases, including:
  </p>

  <h3>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</h3>
  <p>
    Dogetoreum supports the development of DeFi applications, including lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges.
  </p>

  <h3>Tokenization</h3>
  <p>
    Users can create and trade custom tokens representing real-world assets, gaming items, or unique digital art.
  </p>

  <h3>Decentralized Media</h3>
  <p>
    On-chain assets enable content creators to manage copyrights, monetize media, and distribute content directly to their audience without intermediaries.
